# FAQs
## Where can I find it?
The Copypasta mod is developed for Fallout 4 towards the Xbox One platform and is hence available on bethesda.net only.
You can find it [over there][modPageLink].

## Will it be available for PS4?
As it currently stands (and probably will continue to) external assets aren't available for upload along with a plugin file to PS4, due to reasons outside the scope of this page. External assets include (among other things) custom scripts, models and textures; all of which Copypasta currently need to function.
